# Summer Camp 2024 Competition

## The Task

Create a set of Workflows and Activities using any/all of the SDKs that output the set of letters A-Z, in any order.

We leave it up to you to decide what output means...

## Ideas

To give you a feel for the kind of things we imagined when brainstorming, in no particular order:

- Sleep sort
- Races
- Chain different workflows together
    - Continue as new
    - Switching langauges
- Play with error responses (for example: "signal not defined")
- Trigger specific history events then fetch the history

We've also included two simple Go SDK samples: `./race` and `./scavenger`.

## Entering

Submissions should be PRs against this repo on Github, with your complete code and a basic README to explain how to run the Workflow. Please also include a basic description of how your entry works in the README. If your workflow has some surprising/unintuitive behaviour, feel free to leave the outcome as a surprise...

Once you have completed your code, please *submit your entry to the competition* by using the [entry form](https://forms.gle/xRUADGVdnP99ffNA8). PRs for which there has been no submission form received will not be considered for the competition.

Deadline for entries, to allow time for judging, is 28th July, better get cracking!

## Scoring

Judges will be looking for:
- Mixing SDK languages
- Experimenting with Temporal limits
- Charmingly pointless complexity
- Novel methods of output
- Making use of any Temporal behaviour which is surprising/unintuitive
- (Mis-)Using AI, because reasons

Or really anything which makes us smile :)

The judges will pick 3 winners, and 5 runners up. Winners will be announced August 2nd.

## Prizes!!

The 3 winners will receive tickets to Replay in Seattle in September, and some Summer Camp swag.

The 5 runners up will receive Summer Camp swag.

All entries meeting our [code of conduct](https://temporal.io/code-of-conduct) will be mentioned in a blog post announcing the winners on August 2nd.

Enjoy!
